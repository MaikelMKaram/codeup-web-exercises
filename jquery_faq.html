    <h2>LOTR Races</h2>

    <button id="description" type="button">Show Descriptions</button>

    <dl>
        <dt>Hobbits</dt>
        <dd class="invisible">Manlets. Tiny, weak, not suited for fighting. Like to party.</dd>

        <dt>Goblins</dt>
        <dd class="invisible">The hobbit version of orcs. Also tiny and relatively weak, but stupid and disposable, making them useful in horde attacks.</dd>

        <dt>Trolls</dt>
        <dd class="invisible">Highly unintelligent with limited capacity for speech and advanced cognitive skills, but possess incredible physical strength. Typically serve as shock troops for the forces of evil. Easily manipulated. Most varieties can't handle sunlight.</dd>

        <dt>Orcs</dt>
        <dd class="invisible">Somewhere between men and hobbits in terms of size (Chieftains and war leaders tend to be bigger in size), but considerably uglier. Numerous and deadly, but prone to infighting and tribalism, reducing their effectiveness as an army. Never brush their teeth.</dd>

        <dt>Uruk-Hai</dt>
        <dd class="invisible">Orc Special Forces. Bigger, stronger, and smarter than regular Orcs, with organized and disciplined armies Created by Saruman. Limited in numbers.</dd>

        <dt>Dragons</dt>
        <dd class="invisible">Inherently evil, highly intelligent, and small in numbers but large in size. They like hoarding other people's treasures. Can be killed with a single arrow. Highly solitary loners because they don't even like each other that much.</dd>

        <dt>Eagles</dt>
        <dd class="invisible">Originally created as messengers for the Lord of the Valar. Epic, noble creatures who helped Middle-Earth against the forces of evil. Considerably faster and more agile than dragons, though more susceptible to AA and siege weapons due to lack of armor. Featured as 'Merca's emblem.</dd>

        <dt>Dwarves</dt>
        <dd class="invisible">A better, stronger version of the noodle-armed Hobbits. Very stout, much durable, pure chad. Lift weights and hate evil. Good for yeeting at enemies.</dd>

        <dt>Evles</dt>
        <dd class="invisible">Super old race, cool armor, can't die from old age. Maxed out speed and reflex stats, but have never lifted a weight. Also hate evil. Men have girly-looking hair.</dd>

        <dt>Men</dt>
        <dd class="invisible">Numerous and well-equipped. Imperfect, unpredictable, and morally flexible, though generally good. Their flexibility plays to their strength. Played the biggest part in defeating Sauron. Pretty much the vanilla JS of the LOTR universe. </dd>
